# Automate-A-Star-Map-Search-With-Different-Heuristics
Implementation of A* Search Algorithm with Different Heuristics and UI demonstration.

You'll have a grid map where you can create your own obstacles, set goal nodes, set start nodes... The app will use A* Search Algorithm with the chosen Heuristic to create a corresponding shortest path between the nodes.
